# House_Price_Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting house prices using machine learning algorithms. The project aims to develop accurate regression models that can estimate the prices of houses based on various features.   

**Introduction**   
House price prediction is a fundamental task in real estate, finance, and urban planning. Accurate estimation of house prices enables buyers and sellers to make informed decisions, helps financial institutions assess risk, and aids policymakers in understanding market trends. In this project, we aim to develop robust machine learning models to predict house prices based on various features such as size, location, amenities, and more. By leveraging advanced regression algorithms and a comprehensive dataset, we seek to achieve high accuracy and reliability in our predictions.   

**Data set**   
The dataset used in this project consists of historical housing data, including attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location coordinates, proximity to amenities, neighborhood characteristics, and historical sale prices. The dataset is rich and diverse, capturing a wide range of features that influence house prices. Prior to model training, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as cleaning, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables to ensure optimal performance.   

**Algorithms Used**   
*Advanced Regression:*   
For house price prediction, we employ advanced regression algorithms that are capable of capturing complex relationships between input features and target variables. One such algorithm is Gradient Boosting, a powerful ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) to create a strong predictive model. Gradient Boosting iteratively improves the model's performance by fitting new trees to the residual errors of the previous ones. This iterative approach allows the model to focus on areas where it performs poorly, leading to superior predictive accuracy. Additionally, we may explore other advanced regression techniques such as Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and ElasticNet Regression, which offer regularization to prevent overfitting and enhance generalization performance.   

**Conclusion**   
In conclusion, house price prediction is a challenging yet crucial task that can be addressed effectively using advanced regression algorithms. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset and employing techniques such as Gradient Boosting, we can develop robust models capable of accurately predicting house prices. These models have wide-ranging applications in real estate, finance, and urban planning, providing valuable insights into market trends, investment opportunities, and risk assessment. Through this project, we contribute to the advancement of machine learning techniques in the domain of real estate and facilitate informed decision-making for stakeholders involved in the housing market.
